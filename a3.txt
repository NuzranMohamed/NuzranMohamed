Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, because she be that lady! Hey!
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!
Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'mma call her, then I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!
Ooh, Looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a little drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon
You can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me and she's like "Yo!"
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing
"Akon!"
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!
Eminem is rollin', d and em rollin' bo
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rolling'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwing "D!"
Hitting no less than "Three!"
Block wheel style like "Whee!"
Girl I can tell you want me 'cause lately
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-ooohhh!
